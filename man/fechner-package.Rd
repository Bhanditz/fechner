  Fechnerian Scaling of Discrete Object Sets: The R Package fechner
}
\description{
  Fechnerian scaling is a procedure for constructing a metric on a set
  of objects (e.g., symbols, X-ray films).  The constructed Fechnerian
  metric represents subjective dissimilarities among the objects as
  perceived by a system (e.g., person, technical device).  The package
  \pkg{fechner} provides functions and example datasets for performing
  and illustrating Fechnerian scaling of discrete object sets in \R.

  Fechnerian scaling of discrete object (or stimulus) sets provides a
  theoretical framework for deriving, so-called Fechnerian, distances
  among objects representing subjective dissimilarities.  A Fechnerian
  metric on a set of stimuli is constructed from the probabilities
  with which the objects are discriminated from each other by a
  perceiving system.  In addition to the oriented and overall
  Fechnerian distances, the package \pkg{fechner} also computes such
  related information as the points of subjective equality, the
  psychometric increments, the geodesic chains and loops with their
  corresponding lengths, and the generalized Shepardian
  dissimilarities (or \eqn{S}-index).  Moreover, the package
  \pkg{fechner} provides functions for checking the required data
  format and the fundamental regular minimality/maximality condition.
  These concepts are explained in detail in the paper about the
  \pkg{fechner} package by \cite{Kiefer, Uenlue, and Dzhafarov
  (2009)}, and in the theoretical papers by \cite{Dzhafarov and
  Colonius (2006, 2007)} (see \sQuote{References}).

  The package \pkg{fechner} is implemented based on the S3 system.  It
  comes with a namespace, and consists of three external functions
  (functions the package exports): \code{\link{check.data}},
  \code{\link{check.regular}}, and the main function of this package,
  \code{\link{fechner}}.  It also contains six internal functions
  (functions not exported by the package), which are \code{plot},
  \code{print}, and \code{summary} methods for objects of the class
  \code{fechner}, a \code{print} method for objects of the class
  \code{summary.fechner}, and two functions for computing intermediate
  graph-theoretic information: \code{\link{plot.fechner}},
  \code{\link{print.fechner}}, \code{\link{summary.fechner}},
  \code{\link{print.summary.fechner}}, and \link{fechner-internal}.
  The features of the package \pkg{fechner} are illustrated with
  accompanying two real datasets, \code{\link{morse}} and
  \code{\link{wish}}, and two artificial datasets,
  \code{\link{regMin}} and \code{\link{noRegMin}}.
